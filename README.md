Genetic Algorithm for String Generation
This repository contains a simple implementation of a genetic algorithm (GA) for generating a target string. In this example, the target string is "Hello World".

Usage
Requirements
MATLAB or Octave environment
Instructions
Set the desired parameters in the genetic_algorithm.m file, such as population size, maximum number of iterations, elite rate, and mutation rate.
Run the genetic_algorithm.m script in MATLAB or Octave.
The algorithm will start generating strings randomly and evolve them over generations to match the target string "Hello World".
Once the algorithm finds the target string or reaches the maximum number of iterations, it will stop and display the best match found.
Parameters
GA_TARGET: The target string that the algorithm tries to generate.
GA_POP_SIZE: The size of the population, i.e., the number of candidate solutions.
GA_MAX_ITER: The maximum number of iterations the algorithm will run.
GA_ELITE_RATE: The proportion of top-performing individuals preserved from one generation to the next.
GA_MUTATION_RATE: The probability of mutation for each gene in the population.
Results
The algorithm tracks the evolution of the best match found in each generation. It displays the generation number, the fitness (i.e., how close the string is to the target), and the string itself.
